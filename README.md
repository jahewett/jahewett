# A bit about me
:octocat: I’m [Jimi Hewett](https://www.linkedin.com/in/jamesahewett/), an engineering leader currently working at [Clear Bank](https://clear.bank/). With over fifteen years of experience working with engineering teams at some of the UK’s finest fintech startups such as [Monzo Bank](https://monzo.com/) and [Sonovate](http://www.sonovate.com/) (and surviving to tell the tale 🧑‍🚀), I’ve shifted my focus from hands-on product building to developing high-performing teams that deliver real customer and business impact.

## Software isn’t my only passion

### My family ❤️

I’ve been with my wife, Sarah, since I was 18 and she was 17—which officially qualifies as “a long time!” We’ve built a life with our two amazing daughters, Olivia and Lottie, plus our two dalmatians, who are anxious about absolutely everything (except us).

### Functional fitness 💪

For me, fitness isn’t just a routine; it’s a way of life. I balance CrossFit, weightlifting, running, biking, swimming, and even surfing with the chaos of daily life. Dog walks? The unsung hero of stress relief and bonus cardio. Staying active helps me manage the pressures of work and stay mentally healthy.

### Music 🎵

Once upon a time, I was in a band. Want to know the details? Buy me a beer, and I’ll tell you all about the glitz and glamour of touring the UK and Europe in the late 90s! These days, I’ve swapped playing on stage for listening and watching incredible artists and being an *unapologetic* music snob.

### Books & podcasts 🧠

Books and podcasts are my go-to for learning, thinking, and inspiration. Whether it’s leadership insights, fintech trends, or a gripping story, I’m always on the hunt for great recommendations—send them my way!

Let’s connect over fitness, music, or something nerdy... 💚
